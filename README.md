# What is Clear Thought?

Clear-thought is a tool to help pisciners better identify their errors after a correction by the Moulinette.

The 42 school has a one month entrance exam during which we must complete various Shell and C projects.

To validate them, we have to go through an automated system called the moulinette which performs many tests on our code and grades us aftewards.

When the test doesn't go well and our code returns unwanted output, the moulinette sends us an email to help us understand what went wrong.

Unfortunatly , those emails are hard to decifer, especially as someone who never programmed before. They contained informations we don't need and lack a visual hierarchy.

So my goal with this project, is to make those crictic emails, readable by removing less important informations and creating visual hierarchy for better readability.
